{"name":"Karl O'Keeffe","tagline":"","body":"- London, United Kingdom\r\n- karl@monket.net\r\n- http://monket.net\r\n\r\nI currently lead the front end team at Qumu where we are building a cutting edge online video platform.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m a JavaScript (and CoffeeScript) guru who has developed large scale web apps with rich interfaces for Qumu, 7digital, and Philips. I also have experience and passion in Interaction Design and User Experience, advocating heavily for the user. I have over 10 years solid experience coding HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for all browsers (even the shoddy ones). I strongly believe in using tooling to improve the development experience, from transpilers to hot code reloading. I enjoy working with continuous integration and short iterations of improvement and feedback.\r\n\r\nI also feel it is important to understand all levels of development, and have ensured I have real work experience in server side development, project management, testing, and automating deployment. \r\n\r\nI’m looking to focus my career on creating rich web applications that rival their desktop counterparts. I want to be developing using standards based technologies (Javascript and HTML 5), ideally for a large user base. I want to be working on the User Interaction Design and steering the design and behaviour of the apps.
