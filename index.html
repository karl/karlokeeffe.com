<p>I currently lead the front end team at Qumu where we are building a cutting edge online video platform.</p>

<p>I'm a JavaScript (and CoffeeScript) guru who has developed large scale web apps with rich interfaces for Qumu, 7digital, and Philips. I also have experience and passion in Interaction Design and User Experience, advocating heavily for the user. I have over 10 years solid experience coding HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for all browsers (even the shoddy ones). I strongly believe in using tooling to improve the development experience, from transpilers to hot code reloading. I enjoy working with continuous integration and short iterations of improvement and feedback.</p>

<p>I also feel it is important to understand all levels of development, and have ensured I have real work experience in server side development, project management, testing, and automating deployment. </p>

<p>I’m looking to focus my career on creating rich web applications that rival their desktop counterparts. I want to be developing using standards based technologies (Javascript and HTML 5), ideally for a large user base. I want to be working on the User Interaction Design and steering the design and behaviour of the apps. I want to be getting rapid feedback from short development iterations, A/B testing, and usability reviews.</p>
